# Dignity - The Roadmap to Universal Basic Income (UBI)
Dignity consists of a:

1. [Repo](https://github.com/goldfarbas/Dignity) for developing a proof-of-concept of a [monetary](https://github.com/goldfarbas/Dignity/wiki/Monetary-Policy) UBI called the [Dignity (DGNT) token](https://github.com/goldfarbas/Dignity/wiki/Dignity-(DGNT)), and a 

2. [Wiki](https://github.com/goldfarbas/Dignity/wiki) exploring the problems that need to be solved in order to provide UBI and different approaches being taken to create UBI.

## The Dignity (DGNT) Token
The purpose of this proof-of-concept is to demonstrate how to pay for a UBI using [monetary](https://github.com/goldfarbas/Dignity/wiki/Monetary-Policy) rather than [fiscal policy](https://github.com/goldfarbas/Dignity/wiki/Fiscal-Policy).

Most approaches to UBI rely on unsustainable [fiscal policies](https://github.com/goldfarbas/Dignity/wiki/Fiscal-Policy) governing the use of taxes, donations, or other redistributive processes. Using [monetary policy](https://github.com/goldfarbas/Dignity/wiki/Monetary-Policy) means incorporating the expectation of inflation caused by the regular distributions of UBI into the price of the currency.

## Why Dignity?
Dignity can be defined as the quality of being worthy. 

Providing UBI is about recognizing that people don't just create value, we are also inherently valuable and worthy of having a proper foundation to stand on. 

Two important parts of that foundation are having access to basic financial products and services (including UBI) and the information necessary to negotiate mutually-beneficial trade. There are essentially two problems standing in the way of a UBI:

1. How to make it [universal](https://github.com/goldfarbas/Dignity/wiki/Universal)?

2. How to fund it in a [sustainable](https://github.com/goldfarbas/Dignity/wiki/Sustainable) manner?

Visit our [wiki](https://github.com/goldfarbas/Dignity/wiki) to learn and share information about different approaches to solving these problems.

## Roadmap
1. Launch the [Dignity (DGNT) token](https://github.com/goldfarbas/Dignity/wiki/Dignity-(DGNT)) as a proof-of-concept of how to pay for UBI using [monetary](https://github.com/goldfarbas/Dignity/wiki/Monetary-Policy) rather than [fiscal](https://github.com/goldfarbas/Dignity/wiki/Fiscal-Policy) policy.

2. Create a protocol for enabling [unique individuals](https://github.com/goldfarbas/Dignity/wiki/Universal#solving-the-double-claim-problem) to claim UBI

3. Develop [plans](https://github.com/goldfarbas/Dignity/issues) for future development of the project

## Want to get involved?
* We've got [issues](https://github.com/goldfarbas/Dignity/issues) for developing the proof-of-concept.

* Help develop the roadmap to UBI in our [wiki](https://github.com/goldfarbas/Dignity/wiki).
