# Dignity
Dignity (DGNT) is a proof-of-concept of a [monetary](https://github.com/goldfarbas/Dignity/wiki/Monetary-Policy) Universal Basic Income (UBI)

The purpose of this proof-of-concept is to demonstrate how to pay for a UBI using a [monetary](https://github.com/goldfarbas/Dignity/wiki/Monetary-Policy) rather than [fiscal](https://github.com/goldfarbas/Dignity/wiki/Fiscal-Policy) approach.

Most approaches to UBI rely on unsustainable [fiscal](https://github.com/goldfarbas/Dignity/wiki/Fiscal-Policy) policies governing the use of taxes, donations, or other redistributive processes. A [monetary](https://github.com/goldfarbas/Dignity/wiki/Monetary-Policy) approach  means incorporaing the expectation of inflation caused by the regular distributions of UBI into the price of the currency.

## Why Dignity?

Dignity can be defined as the quality of being worthy. 

Providing UBI is about recognizing that people don't just create value, we are also inherently valuable and worthy of having a proper foundation to stand on. 

Two important parts of that foundation are having access to basic financial products and services (including UBI) and the information necessary to negotiate mutually-beneficial trade. There are essentially two problems standing in the way of a UBI:

1. How to make it [universal](https://github.com/goldfarbas/Dignity/wiki/Universal)?
2. How to fund it in a [sustainable](https://github.com/goldfarbas/Dignity/wiki/Sustainable) manner?

## Roadmap

1. Launch the Dignity (DGNT) token as a proof-of-concept to demonstrate how to pay for a UBI using [monetary](https://github.com/goldfarbas/Dignity/wiki/Monetary-Policy) rather than [fiscal](https://github.com/goldfarbas/Dignity/wiki/Fiscal-Policy) policy.
2. Create a protocol for enabling [unique individuals](https://github.com/goldfarbas/Dignity/wiki/Universal#solving-the-double-claim-problem) to claim UBI
3. Develop plans for future integrations

## Want to get involved?
* We've got **[issues](https://github.com/goldfarbas/Dignity/issues)** for developing the proof-of-concept.
* Help develop the roadmap to UBI in our **[wiki](https://github.com/goldfarbas/Dignity/wiki)**.
