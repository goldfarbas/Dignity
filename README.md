# Dignity
Proof-of-concept of a monetary Universal Basic Income (UBI)

The purpose of this proof-of-concept is to demonstrate how to pay for a UBI using a monetary rather than fiscal approach.

Most approaches to UBI rely on unsustainable fiscal policies governing the use of taxes, donations, or other redistributive processes. A monetary approach essentially means adding the amount of money distributed through a UBI to 

## Why Dignity?

Dignity can be defined as the quality of being worthy. Providing UBI is about recognizing that people don't just create value, we are also inherently valuable. We can't make anything our inherent value without a proper foundation to stand on. An important part of that foundation is having access to money and another part is understanding the value of money.

There are essentially two problems standing in the way of a UBI:

1. How to make it [universal](https://github.com/goldfarbas/Dignity/wiki/Universal)?
2. How to fund it in a [sustainable](https://github.com/goldfarbas/Dignity/wiki/Sustainable) manner?
