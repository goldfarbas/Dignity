# Dignity
Proof-of-concept of a monetary Universal Basic Income (UBI)

The purpose of this proof-of-concept is to demonstrate how to pay for a UBI using a monetary rather than fiscal approach.

Most approaches to UBI rely on unsustainable fiscal policies governing the use of taxes, donations, or other redistributive processes. A monetary approach essentially means adding the amount of money distributed through a UBI to 

## Why Dignity?

When talking about ideas like the "minimum wage" and "basic income," a friend once pointed out that "minimum" and "basic" always refer to the lowest amount we're willing to guarantee a working person as a collective, governed society. What is the lowest amount of resources a working person with nothing can expect to have at their disposal to satisfy their needs? We may not have the power to change how society views or values us as singular individuals but we can decide what <i>we</i> think we're worth. 

What's the lowest amount you need to get by? That's your dignity.


It's true that having a minimum wage and/or basic income limits a person's ability to negotiate employment for wages below the established threshold, which can increase unemployment if businesses can't make enough revenue to stay in business. It's also true that creating a minimum wage and/or basic income forces businesses to establish higher standards in order to maintain profits, which sets a higher standard for the basic dignity a worker can expect to enjoy.

## What's needed to scale?

- A "universal" income needs universal distribution, which means global access to smart phones, secure digital wallets, and internet.

- Solving the "double-claim" problem: Incorporating sybil rank & other approaches to prevent fake accounts from collecting claims.

- While the token would hold its own value using this approach, part of its utility would need to stem from its ability to be exchanged for fiat currencies as necessary.
